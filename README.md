### Background of the Study
Drought and other severe climatic conditions immensely contribute to acute food insecurity in Africa, specifically in the Horn of Africa. Over the years, an increase in the population has resulted in the destruction of the environment, especially with the clearance of forests to accommodate the growing population. Farmers have realized reduced productivity both for themselves and for the market. Unsustainable use of the available land in arid and semi-arid areas and encroachment of settlement in arable land has exacerbated the issue. The employment of technology in analyzing land use and how best to maximize productivity is key to the realization of agricultural produce throughout the region.

### Statement of the Problem
The world over, governments aim to attain food security. Homegrown agricultural produce assures both subsistence and affordable food prices. Thus, the problem statement is the determination of the relationship between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and maize in Kenya. NDVI is used to determine the density of vegetation health. The higher the NDVI value, the healthier the vegetation and vice versa.

## Objectives

### General Objective
- The general objective is the prediction of maize yield using a simple linear regression model.

### Specific Objectives
- To perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between maize yield and NDVI.
- To fit and evaluate the fit of the model.
- To use the model for the prediction of future maize yields.

## Methodology
- The theory of Simple Linear Regression Model was applied in this study to analyze the relationship between NDVI and maize yield.
- R software was used to fit the models and also in the prediction of maize yield for the years 2023-2027.
- The data for the study was collected from the Ministry of Agriculture, Kilimo House, consisting of maize yield records, and from the Kenya Space Agency, consisting of NDVI measurements.

## Summary
In this study, the theory of Simple Linear Regression Model was used in the analysis of the relationship between NDVI and maize yield. Statistical software R was used in this study. The main objective was to demonstrate the potential of utilizing satellite imagery, specifically NDVI, to estimate maize yield. The study incorporated NDVI data from five counties and maize yield data from the same five counties, in the years 2018-2022. A significant positive linear relationship between NDVI and maize yield was observed, indicating a significant correlation between NDVI and maize yield.

## Conclusions
From the results of the model, we can say that an increase in NDVI causes an increase in maize yield. The results obtained from the analysis indicate that there is a direct relationship between NDVI and crop yield.
Specifically, it was observed that higher NDVI values corresponded to higher crop yields, while lower NDVI values were associated with lower crop yields. This finding suggests that an increase in NDVI, as measured by satellite imagery, can be indicative of improved vegetation health and, consequently, enhanced agricultural productivity.
Conversely, a decrease in NDVI may signify poorer vegetation conditions and lower crop yields. These results highlight the potential of utilizing NDVI data from satellite imagery as a tool to predict and monitor crop yield, offering valuable insights for agricultural management and interventions.

## Recommendations
Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the use of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and artificial neural networks can be explored as an alternative to traditional statistical models for analyzing NDVI data and predicting crop yield. It is also recommended that the use of satellite imagery data can help us analyze how land topology affects vegetation health and growth in Kenya.
